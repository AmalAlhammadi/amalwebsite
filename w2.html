     <h1>Computer Controlled Cutting</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
    <p> This week was a complete on-site work. We have learned laser cutting and 3D Printing techniques</p>

      <p style="font-size:30px;color:blue;">&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Laser cutting ?</p>
         <p>Laser cutting is a technique that involves vaporizing materials with a laser to create a cut edge. The material is targeted by a focused laser beam, which melts, burns, vaporizes, or is blown away by a jet of gas, leaving an edge with a high-quality finish.</p>
            <p>Before starting using a laser cutter, we have designed the desired shape using <a class="link text-decoration-none " href="https://www.coreldraw.com/en/pages/free-download/">CorelDraw </a> software. I have chosen to create an MDF car medal for my brother. There are two hints that the machine understands to differentiate between engraving and cutting elements. The hints are that the engraved part has been marked in black, while the cut part has been marked in red. </p>
    <p>The following steps have been followed in order to design and produce the medal key:</p>
    <p>1-Design whatever you  want using CorelDraw</p>
    <center> <img src="assets/img/week3/car%20medal.png" width="600" height="350"/></center>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>2-Mark the part that you want to be cut in red >> right click on the color bar</p>
    <p>3-Mark the part that you want to be engraved in black >> right click on the color bar</p>
    <p>4-Save the design file as (.dxf extension) </p>
    <p>5-Go to print >> preferences</p>
    <p>6-Adjust the material setting >> currently choose the default values</p>
    <center><img src="assets/img/week3/defult.png" width="700" height="400"/></center>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>7-Open Universal Laser System machine software to allocate the design position and review its location</p>
    <p>8-Wait 30s to avoid getting the smoke out! </p>
    <p>9-Take off your design</p>
        
    <p>MY final result is shown in the below figure: </p>
       <center><img src="assets/img/week3/final%20design.jpeg" width="700" height="400"/></center>                
                                 
                                
                                    
                                    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="font-size:30px;color:blue;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Group assignment</p>
    <p>A group assignment has been assigned to us by the engineer. It was about selecting material and playing with its setting (power and speed) to test how it affects the cutting and engraving. My chosen material is MDF wood, where I tested a small circle piece. I end up with 15 trials to acquire and reach out to the best setting levels. Here is shown some of these trials: </p>
    
    <p>For the first trial, I have used the stander setting of the machine. The engraving was good; but a better result could be accomplished. The cutting was too bad because its edge was burned </p>
    
  <center>
    <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Setting</th>
    <th>Power</th>
    <th>Speed</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cutting(Red)&nbsp;</td>
    <td>100%</td>
    <td>6.4%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engraving(Black)&nbsp;</td>
    <td>80%</td>
    <td>100%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>  
</table>
      </center>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    
     <p>A second trial has been made by reducing the speed of the engraving and its power. I noticed that the digging depth was perfect, but it's too slow, so I re-increased its rate to the full operating level, which is the third trial. Now, the engraving setting has been constant since I reached an outstanding output. </p>
         
    <center><table>
  <tr>
    <th>Setting</th>
    <th>Power</th>
    <th>Speed</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cutting(Red)</td>
    <td>100%(defult)</td>
    <td>6.4% (defult)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engraving(Black)</td>
    <td>71.3s%</td>
    <td>100%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  
</table>   </center>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>Moving to the cutting setting, many experiments have been concocted to reduce the side-burning effects. The power level kept constant with varying speed values. In conclusion, as much as reducing the speed is better. Till this point, the speed reached 9.5% while the power is still constant at 100%.</p>
    
    <center><table>                             
         <tr>
    <th>Setting</th>
    <th>Power</th>
    <th>Speed</th>
         </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cutting(Red)</td>
    <td>100%</td>
    <td>9.5%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engraving(Black)</td>
    <td>71.3%</td>
    <td>100%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      </table>  </center>   
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>After that, the speed is constant now while the power is varied. Downsizing the power level was the key to success. A 26.6% has been used, but again I fixed it and played with the speed again. As we decrease both values, the final product contains less side-burning amount. By reaching 1.1% of operating speed and 15% of source power, I achieved my goal and got the lowest burning amount. </p>
    
    <center><table>                             
         <tr>
    <th>Setting</th>
    <th>Power</th>
    <th>Speed</th>
         </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cutting(Red)</td>
    <td>15%</td>
    <td>1.1%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engraving(Black)</td>
    <td>71.3s%</td>
    <td>100%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      </table>  </center>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    
    <h5 style="color:red;">Note:</h5>
    <p>Another effect taken into consideration is the design size. If the same setting has been applied to a different size of the same shape, the biggest one contains fewer burning effects. So the size takes a role while working.</p>
